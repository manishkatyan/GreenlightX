# Who Can See and Share My Personal Data When I Use TokBird?

When you send messages or join meetings and webinars on TokBird, other people and organizations, including third parties outside the meeting, webinar, or message, may be able to see content and information that you share:

- **Account Owner** :  An account owner is the organization or individual that signs up for a TokBird account.  Typically, an account owner designates one or more people (called an &quot;administrator&quot;) to manage their account and can grant privileges to users on the account.  Depending on their license with TokBird, the account owner can authorize additional users on their account, and the account owner can create and/or access the profile information for all users on their account.  The account owner and their users can invite others (including guests not on their account) to meetings or webinars hosted on their account.

 TokBird gives account owners controls and features that they can use to determine whether certain types of content, such as recordings or out-of-meeting messages, can be created or sent, and what third-party apps can be used, for meetings and webinars hosted on their account.  Depending on their settings, account owners and the people they designate can access personal data for people who join meetings and webinars on their account or send messages to users on their account.  Specifically, account owners may have access to:
  - **Account Usage:**
    - **Product Usage:**  Information about how people and their devices interact with their account, which may include who sent messages to their users in chat, email addresses, IP addresses, device information, and other information about who joined meetings or webinars on their account, whether users viewed or downloaded a recording, how long people participated in their meetings, the time a message was sent, information about TokBird Phone integrations, and other usage information and feedback metrics.
    - **Participant List:**   Information about the participants in a TokBird meeting, webinar, or chat, which may include name, display name, email address, phone number, and participant or user ID.
  - **Registration Information:** Information provided during registration for a webinar, meeting, or recording hosted by the account.
  - **In-Meeting/Webinar Messages:**  Depending on their settings, account owners can see sender and receiver information, along with the content of messages sent to and from users on their account, in the following circumstances:
    - Messages sent to Everyone in a meeting that is recorded
    - Messages sent to panelists in a webinar that is recorded
    - Direct messages if the account owner has enabled archiving
  - **Recordings:**   Account owners can watch the content of recordings of meetings and webinars hosted on their account.  They can also view a transcript of meeting audio, if enabled.
  - **Polling, Q&amp;A, and Feedback** :  Account owners can see information about who provided responses to their polls, Q&amp;A, or post meeting or webinar feedback requests, including name and contact information, together with the responses or feedback, unless responses are submitted anonymously.
- **Meeting Hosts and Participants** :  Hosts and other participants in a meeting may be able to see your email, display name, and profile picture.  Meeting hosts and participants can also see and (depending on the account owner&#39;s settings) record or save meeting content, audio transcripts, messages sent to Everyone or to them directly, and files, whiteboards, or other information shared during a meeting.  Hosts may also be able to see responses to Q&amp;A and polls generated during the meeting.
- **Webinar Panelists and Attendees:** Only panelists may be visible to attendees during a webinar, but attendees who agree to unmute can be heard by other attendees.  If an attendee agrees to become a panelist during a webinar, they may be visible to other attendees, depending on settings.  Panelists and attendees may be able to see the name of a participant who asks a question during a Q&amp;A, along with their question, unless the participant submits the question anonymously.
- **Livestreams:** Meeting and webinar hosts can choose to livestream to a third-party site or service, which means anyone with access to the livestream will be able to see the meeting or webinar.
- **Third-Party Apps and Integrations:**
  - Account owners can choose to add third-party apps to their account and the TokBird Products they use, and they can also give their users permission to add and use specific third-party apps, including in meetings, webinars, and chats hosted on their account.  Depending on their settings, account owners and their users and guests can share your personal data and content with third-party apps and integrations they approve, which may include all of the personal data available to account owners, hosts, and participants listed above, such as account information, profile and contact information, registration information, participants list, settings, content, product usage, and device information.
  - Other participants in the meeting may be able to see the third-party app that you are using in a meeting, if the third-party app is receiving real-time features and information from the meeting.
  - Third-party developers may also integrate or embed TokBird meetings into their website or app experiences or build versions of TokBird that enable access to TokBird Products from a third-party app.
  - Personal information shared by account owners and users with third-party apps and integrations is collected and processed in accordance with the app developers&#39; terms and privacy policies, not TokBird&#39;s.

**Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data**

We only use your information in a lawful, transparent, and fair manner. Depending on the specific personal data concerned and the factual context, when TokBird processes personal data as a controller for individuals in regions such as the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK, we rely on the following legal bases as applicable in your jurisdiction:

- **As necessary for our contract:** When we enter into a contract directly with you, we process your personal data on the basis of our contract in order to prepare and enter into the contract, as well as to perform and manage our contract (i.e., providing TokBird Products, features and services to account owners, their users, and those they invite to join meetings and webinars hosted on their accounts, and manage our relationship and contract, including billing, compliance with contractual obligations, and related administration). If we do not process your personal data for these purposes, we may not be able to provide you with all Products, features, and services;
- **Consistent with specific revocable consents:** We rely on your prior consent in order to utilize cookies to engage advertising and analytics partners to deliver tailored advertising and analysis of our website usage. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time by visiting our cookie management tool;
- **As necessary to comply with our legal obligations:** We process your personal data to comply with the legal obligations to which we are subject for the purposes of compliance with EEA laws, regulations, codes of practice, guidelines, or rules applicable to us, and for responses to requests from, and other communications with, competent EEA public, governmental, judicial, or other regulatory authorities. This includes detecting, investigating, preventing, and stopping fraudulent, harmful, unauthorized, or illegal activity (&quot;fraud and abuse detection&quot;) and compliance with privacy laws;
- **To protect your vital interests or those of others:** We process certain personal data in order to protect vital interests for the purpose of detecting and preventing illicit activities that impact vital interests and public safety, including child sexual abuse material; and
- **As necessary for our (or others&#39;) legitimate interests, unless those interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms, which require protection of personal data:** We process your personal data based on such legitimate interests to (i) enter and perform the contract with the account owner and/or reseller providing you with the Products (which includes billing, compliance with contractual obligations, and related administration and support); (ii) develop, test, and improve our Products and troubleshoot products and features; (iii) ensure authentication, integrity, security, and safety of accounts, activity, and Products, including detect and prevent malicious conduct and violations of our terms and policies, prevent or investigate bad or unsafe experiences, and address security threats; (iv) send marketing communications, advertising, and promotions related to the Products; and (v) comply with non-EEA laws, regulations, codes of practice, guidelines, or rules applicable to us and respond to requests from, and other communications with, competent non-EEA public, governmental, judicial, or other regulatory authorities, as well as meet our corporate and social responsibility commitments, protect our rights and property and the ones of our customers, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements.

**International Data Transfers**

TokBird operates globally, which means personal data may be transferred, stored (for example, in a data center), and processed outside of the country or region where it was initially collected where TokBird or its service providers have customers or facilities – including in countries where meeting participants or account owners hosting meetings or webinars that you participate in or receiving messages that you send are based.

Therefore, by using TokBird Products or providing personal data for any of the purposes stated above, you acknowledge that your personal data may be transferred to or stored in the United States where we are established, as well as in other countries outside of the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK. Such countries may have data protection rules that are different and less protective than those of your country.

We protect your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Statement wherever it is processed and take appropriate contractual or other steps to protect it under applicable laws. Where personal data of users in the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK is being transferred to a recipient located in a country outside the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK which has not been recognized as having an adequate level of data protection, we ensure that the transfer is governed by the European Commission&#39;s standard contractual clauses. Please contact us if you would like further information in that respect.

# California Privacy Rights

**California Consumer Privacy Act**

Under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), California residents may have a right to:

- **Access**  the categories and specific pieces of personal data TokBird has collected, the categories of sources from which the personal data is collected, the business purpose(s) for collecting the personal data, and the categories of third parties with whom TokBird has shared personal data;
- **Delete**  personal data under certain circumstances; and
- **Opt out of the &quot;sale&quot;**  of personal data. We do not sell your personal data in the conventional sense. However, like many companies, we use advertising services that try to tailor online ads to your interests based on information collected via cookies and similar technologies about your online activity. This is called interest-based advertising. The CCPA&#39;s statutory definition of the term &quot;sale&quot; is broad and may include interest-based advertising. You can get more information and opt out of the use of cookies on our sites for interest-based advertising purposes by clicking the [Do Not Sell My Personal Information](https://zoom.us/privacy#:~:text=Zoom%20uses%20customer%20content%20only,may%20choose%20to%20share%20information.) link, in the webpage footer, and setting your preferences. You will need to set your preferences from each device and each web browser from which you wish to opt out. This feature uses a cookie to remember your preference, so if you clear all cookies from your browser, you will need to reset your settings.

TokBird will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights, which is further in line with your rights under the CCPA.

To exercise your rights, contact us by emailing privacy@TokBird.us or calling +1-888-799-9666. To opt out of the use of cookies on our sites for interest-based advertising purposes, follow the instructions above.

We will acknowledge receipt of your request within 10 business days, and provide a substantive response within 45 calendar days, or inform you of the reason and extension period (up to 90 days) in writing.

Under the CCPA, only you or an authorized agent may make a request related to your personal data. Note that to respond to your requests to access or delete personal data under the CCPA, we must verify your identity. We may do so by requiring you to log into your TokBird account (if applicable), provide information relating to your account (which will be compared to information we have, such as profile information), give a declaration as to your identity under penalty of perjury, and/or provide additional information. You may designate an authorized agent to submit your verified consumer request by providing written permission and verifying your identity, or through proof of power of attorney.

**California&#39;s Shine the Light Law**

California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as &quot;Shine The Light&quot; law, permits California residents to annually request information regarding the disclosure of your Personal Information (if any) to third parties for the third parties&#39; direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. We do not share Personal Information with third parties for the third parties&#39; direct marketing purposes.
